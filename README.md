# Shell Script Card Catalog

## Purpose

This little script helps you organize, create, edit, and execute your shell scripts. I created it to save me the time of always having to `cd` into my scripts directory and type out the script names. Newly created scripts have the shebang preset, saving even more time. I may add more features in the future depending on what seems most useful.

## Usage

For the initial setup, run the script from your terminal.

```
./sscc.sh
```

After the first run, you can run SSCC from anywhere using the following command:

```
sscc
```
